<p style="color:white;">As I mentioned before I am nineteen years old and in college. I am a sophomore at Saint Anselm College and pursuing a degree in marketing. Saint Anselm is a great school, located in between Manchester and Goffstown New Hampshire. The school is a small enclosed campus with a relatively small student population which makes the school feel like a tight community. 
 </p>

<p style="color:white;"> Prior to Saint Anselm I attended Sacred Heart High School for my Freshman year and continued my education at Silver Lake Regional High school where I graduated. As I mentioned before I am from Halifax, with my high school being regional it included two other towns, Plympton and Kingston. For the year I attended Sacred Heart, I played Soccer, Basketball, and Lacrosse for the school and continued my Lacrosse career when I transferred to my regional public school.

<p style="color:white;"> Over the years I have met many new people and have made great friendships and connections along the way to college.  Becoming a college student with new people all around me gave me the opportunity I needed to grow as over those years I have learned to be a great communicator.
