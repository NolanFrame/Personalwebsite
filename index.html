<p style="color:white;">Hi my name is Nolan Frame, I am currently 19 years old and grew up in Halifax, Massachusetts. I come from a family of four with one younger sister and two great and loving parents. My mom and dad both grew up in Massachusetts, we lived in Braintree MA, until I was about three years old then made the move to a less established, quiet town where my parents wanted to raise kids. 
 </p>

<p style="color:white;"> I also have family in San Antonio Texas that I visit often, it is beautiful down there mostly year round. My Nana, and two of my Aunts and Uncles live down there with my cousins who are all younger than fifteen years old. I recommend you visit Texas if you ever have the opportunity, the architecture, people, food, and nature is amazing and is a great place overall.

<p style="color:white;"> Lastly, my favorite meal is Steak, Mashed Potatoes, and Caesar salad, I love this meal for a couple of reasons. First-off, this meal when home cooked is the best, my dad grills like a professional, and the mashed potatoes from my mom are always amazing. Secondly, this meal is usually eaten when it is my birthday or any celebratory moment where I get the choice of meal for dinner. This meal is not only my favorite for its taste, it is my favorite because it usually means the family is all together at the dinner table.
