<p style="color:white;">I love to ski, skiing has always been my favorite winter activity as my family and I have skied every winter since I was around five years old. I have a lot of experience with the sport so I consider myself an expert mountain terrain skier although I am a bot when it comes to the people I look up to in the sport, especially freestyle skiers like Candide Thovex who throw flips at uncomfortable speeds.

<p style="color:white;"> Skiing brings my family together, especially now as I am nineteen in college and my sister is now a senior in High School so we as kids are busy. The winter is when I am on break as well as my sister. We take weekley trips up to our condo in New Hampshire with our parents which is nice as I never see my family anymore. Skiing has a lot of memories attached to it especially with my dad who you would imagine is a little more riskier on his skis when it comes to my mom, and memories with friends like funny moments on the mountain.

<p style="color:white;"> Overall skiing is something I always want to improve at, skiing is something that I will always hold near and dear to my heart, and it is something that allows my family to get together and create memories. If you have not skied yet I would definitely recommend you attempt to learn, it isn't easy but once you get the hang of it, have fun!
