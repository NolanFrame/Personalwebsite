<p style="color:white;">Ever since first grade I have always drawn in the margins of the my classwork, even now in college I catch myself doodling during class, this is something I learned helps me focus. Over the years my drawing progressed and I began to watch youtube where I was able to discover multiple artists, Vexx being a main inspiration behind the style of my work. I like to draw on things to make them unique, I have customized shoes, airpods, iphone cases, and even a cereal bowl for my friend's birthday.

<p style="color:white;"> Art is a big part of my life, I am a marketing major and hope to explore a path where I can express my creativity through design. More specifically, I have recently been diving into Graphic Design on my own, creating a couple of wall-papers for my computer,  and also signing up for a class next semester at my college. I want to start or work for a company that uses graphic design to enhance companies Advertising plans and communication to their targeted audiences.

<p style="color:white;">Overall art has always had a huge impact on how I live my life, even if it isn't something physically drawn, I feel as if art is all around us. Art and beauty are tied in together, we appreciate the beauty we perceive in our lives like nature, sounds, smells, and even memories with people. Art allows us to share and interpret feelings as we all are impacted by the art and beauty of the world around you whether if you know it or not.
